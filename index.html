  I was a ghost, I was alone
어두워진 앞길 속에 (ah)
Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe
I was the queen that I'm meant to be
I lived two lives, tried to play both sides
But I couldn't find my own place
Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild
But now that's how I'm getting paid 끝없이 on stage
I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe
We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, I'm done hidin' now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be
Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see
No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be
'Cause we are hunters, voices strong, and I know I believe
We're goin' up, up, up, it's our moment
You know together we're glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, up, up, up, with our voices
영원히 깨질 수 없는
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, I'm done hidin', now I'm shining like I'm born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be
You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden
We're gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin'
밝게 빛나는 우린
You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies
That's who we're born to be

  I tried to hide, but something broke
I tried to sing, couldn't hit the notes
The words kept catching in my throat
I tried to smile, I was suffocating though
But here with you, I can finally breathe
You say you're no good, but you're good for me
I've been hoping to change, now I know we can change
But I won't if you're not by my side
Why does it feel right every time I let you in?
Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?
All the secrets that keep me in chains, and
All the damage that might make me dangerous
You got a dark side, guess you're not the only one
What if we both tried fighting what we're running from?
We can't fix it if we never face it
What if we find a way to escape it?
We could be free, free
We can't fix it if we never face it
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless
Oh, time goes by, and I lose perspective
Yeah, hope only hurts, so I just forget it
But you're breaking through all the dark in me
When I thought that nobody could
And you're waking up all these parts of me
That I thought were buried for good
Between imposter and this monster, I've been lost inside my head
Ain't no choice when all these voices keep me pointing towards no end
It's just easy when I'm with you
No one sees me the way you do
I don't trust it, but I want to
I keep coming back to
Why does it feel right every time I let you in?
Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?
We can't fix it if we never face it
What if we find a way to escape it?
We could be free, free
We can't fix it if we never face it
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless
Oh-oh, so take my hand, it's open (free, free)
What if we heal what's broken? (Free, free)
I tried to hide, but something broke
I couldn't sing, but you give me hope
We can't fix it if we never face it
Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless

[Intro]
[Verse]
Title: Easy Code (Like ABC)Feelin’ stuck till Techcamp showed the way—
Now code feels bright and day.

[Verse 1]
I once believed coding was a maze,
A wild web of endless daze.
But then I joined Techcamp to learn,
Suddenly the barriers turned.

[Pre-Chorus]
Step by step, line by line,
They helped me shape my curious mind.

[Chorus]
Coding now is easy as ABC,
With Techcamp, I’ve set my spirit free.
Every function, loop, and key—
It’s like learning simple ABC.

[Verse 2]
With guidance clear and skillful care,
I built first app, with tech to share.
Each project grows just like a tree,
Powered by knowledge — code so clean.

[Bridge]
No more fear, now I build and strive,
From zero to coder, I came alive.
Code flows smooth, I’ve found the key—
Techcamp lights my creativity.

[Yoruba Call & Response] (Spoken/Sung)
Mo fẹ́ kọ́ — (I want to learn)
Ẹ kọ́ pẹ̀lú mi — (Come learn with me)
Àṣeyọrí wa níwájú — (Success is ahead)
Jẹ́ ká kọ́de — (Let’s code!)

[Final Chorus]
Coding’s smooth like ABC,
Thanks to Techcamp, now I believe.
Turn ideas into reality—
Turn ideas into reality—
Techcamp helped me cross the line.
Simple steps and a vision free—
Coding’s now just ABC.
Coding’s now just ABC.
